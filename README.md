# Docks-Away
Marina Dry Storage App


## Main Goal of this project:
    - This website will be able to add, edit, delete, launch, stow, move customer's boat around a Dry Stack facility


#### Model:
    - This will follow the Agile(Adaptive Software Development Methods) Model
        - This is due to clarity on future task and will allow me to adapt to changing requirements
        - The requirments change depending on the Marinas, location, heavy machinary as well as the boating industry as it is constatly changing

#### Planning Stage:
    - This project will be geared towards a Dry Stack Facility
    - Be able to create, update, delete customers
    - Be able to create, update, delete boats
    - Be able to assign, store and move boats to the proper dry stack assigned area
    - Be abe to stow and launch boats to the docks, work racks and to the individual customer(for maintenance, or winter storage)
    - Be able to delete or edit launch(time)
    - At this time I would like to focus on these tasks first then if time allows add more features to this app
        - Real time scheduling
        - API to be able to watch the weather of the given area as most customers do not live next to the Marina
        - Possible include a store front (example, gas, ice and products from the Marina)

#### Design:
    - I am going to use React and javascript for the frontend
    - Flask and python 3 for the backend
    - MySQL for the database due to relationships of the tables.
